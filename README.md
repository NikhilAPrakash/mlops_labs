# MLOps Labs

This repository contains hands-on labs and projects for learning and practicing MLOps concepts, including workflow orchestration, model training, deployment, and automation using tools like Apache Airflow and FastAPI.

## Repository Structure

- `airflow_lab2/`  
  Orchestrate machine learning workflows using Apache Airflow. Includes DAGs for data preprocessing, model training, and more.
- `fastapi_lab1/`  
  Build and serve machine learning models using FastAPI. Includes endpoints for training and prediction.

## Labs Overview

### Airflow Lab 2
- Lab 2 of IE7374 MLOPs Lab
- Using Apache Airflow for automating ML pipelines.
- Key components:
  - DAGs for data loading, preprocessing, model training, saving, and loading.
  - Docker Compose setup for easy deployment.
  - Logs and configuration for Airflow tasks.

### FastAPI Lab 1
- Lab 2 of IE7374 MLOPs Lab
- Building REST API for ML models using FastAPI.
- Key components:
  - Endpoints for training and prediction.
  - Pre-trained models for iris and wine datasets.
  - Example results and assets.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
